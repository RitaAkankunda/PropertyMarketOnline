## Alternative: Skip Nameservers for Now?

**Actually, wait!** 

If your DNS records are already showing in Cloudflare, the nameservers might already be pointing to Cloudflare, OR we can add the Resend DNS records directly in Cloudflare and they should work.

**Let's try this:**
1. The Resend DNS records are already in Cloudflare (I saw them!)
2. Go back to Resend
3. Click "I've added the records"
4. See if it verifies

**If it doesn't verify, then we need to update nameservers.**

---

## What To Do Right Now

**Option 1 (Easiest):**
1. Go back to your Resend domain page
2. Click "I've added the records"
3. See if it verifies (might work if DNS is already set up)

**Option 2 (If Option 1 doesn't work):**
1. Check your email (search "propertymarketonline")
2. Tell me what sender/registrar you find
3. I'll give you exact steps

**Try Option 1 first - it might already work!** 🚀
